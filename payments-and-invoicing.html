		<h1 class="responsive">Research Case Study</h1>
			<p>The business's core product was a two-sided marketplace to connect consumers who need a job done with local service providers (e.g. carpenters, photographers, removalists, etc.) who are available to do the work.</p>

		<h3>Business Problem</h3>
		As a result of the organisation pivoting to a different revenue model, there was a business need to collect transaction data (which often occurred offline).

		<h3>Research Objective</h3>
		Establish the existing mental model regarding payments for jobs. Ascertain why certain payment methods are preferred and if there are any opportunities to improve the experience in an online setting.
		
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		We aimed to encourage our businesses to conduct their transactions onsite by addressing their existing pain points when getting paid. The product we were introducing was a system to allow businesses to accept credit card payments from customers online and/or via mobile. This made it easier for customers to settle payment immediately after the job which, in turn, addressed the anxiety of service providers around getting paid on time/at all. It also allowed businesses to overcome the barrier that had prevented them (i.e. cost) from accepting credit card payments.
