		<h1 class="responsive">Research Case Study</h1>
			<p>The business's core product was a two-sided marketplace to connect consumers who need a job done with local service providers (e.g. carpenters, photographers, removalists, etc.) who are available to do the work.</p>

		<h3>Business Problem</h3>
		As a result of the organisation pivoting to a different revenue model, there was a business need to collect transaction data (which often occurred offline).

		<h3>Research Objective</h3>
		Establish the existing mental model regarding payments for jobs. Ascertain why certain payment methods are preferred and if there are any opportunities to improve the experience in an online setting.
		
		<h3>Methodology</h3>

		<h3>Key Insights</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Customers generally wanted to do what was easiest for the business. Businesses had the higher status in the transaction.</li>
			<li>Businesses were very anxious about getting paid, and they hated doing admin and chasing people up.</li>
			<li>Cash was preferable for smaller jobs and/or where the cost was known. It was the quickest option if you had enough cash on hand.</li>
			<li>Bank transfer was preferable for large and/or less predictable amounts. It was traceable and didn't require withdrawing money beforehand, but it carried the risk of delayed payment.</li>
			<li>While customers would have liked to pay with card, accepting credit cards wasn't worth it for businesses</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		Our solution was allowing businesses to take credit card payments at no extra cost to allow customers more flexibility. We also aimed to streamline the invoicing/payment process to a quick in-person interaction at the end of the job. That is, using a combination of a verbal prompt from Mick and a push notification/SMS to request and authorise an electronic payment. This combines the immediacy and social accountability of cash with the flexibility and traceability of a bank transfer.
