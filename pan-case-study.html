		<h1 class="responsive">Research Case Study</h1>
			<p>This was a personal project for a ten week bootcamp program that spanned research and discovery right through to high fidelity design.</p>

		<h2>Problem Space</h2>
		Young professionals experience a transition from ample free time to almost none, and the effort required to keep in touch with their university friends dramatically increases. Combined with all other changes associated with this new life stage (e.g. new social circles, hobbies, responsibilities, etc.), this can lead to friends drifting apart without even realising it.

			<h2>UX Strategy</h2>

				<h3>Vision</h3>
					Young professionals experience a transition from ample free time to almost none, and the effort required to keep in touch with their university friends dramatically increases. The vision for this project was to help those young professionals keep in touch with their university friends (who are often in the same boat) and avoid drifting apart. 


						<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
						I believe that designing an automatic social plan-making tool for young professionals will help them effortlessly keep in touch width a large number of people in their limited free time. 
						
						<p>I will know this is true when I see that the reasons for plan failure relate to dragging out the process (due to calendar alignment, making choices, etc.), or if after launch, when 50% of users of proposed plans are accepted.</p>



				<br /><h2>Research</h2>
				The following artefacts were created based on interviews with busy professionals.


				<h3>Personas</h3>
				At the start, I formed two proto personas. One for personal use (John, a recent grad with an active social life), and one for professional use (Helen, a sought after industry figure). I chose to focus on John as my primary persona, and the bulk of my research was with people who fit John's persona.
				<br /> <br />

				<A href="john.png"><img src="john.png" class="fortyfive"/></A>

				<h3>Experience Maps</h3>
				I created experience maps to empathise with my personas and identify opportunities for design intervention. I found that the most friction happened in the organising of the meeting. 
				<br/><br />

				<a href="ExpMap Helen.jpg"><img src="ExpMap Helen.jpg" class="fortyfive" /></a>


				<h3>How Might We...</h3>
				I came up with a number of "How might we" questions based on the pain points experienced by John, including how might we:

				<ul>
					<li />Reduce the number of interactions required to arrange a meeting
					<li />Make calendar alignment more accurate
					<li />Facilitate decisiveness with plans
					<li />Facilitate regular contact between friends/colleagues
					<li />Motivate people to make time for their friends
				</ul>

				However, in keeping with my hypothesis, I ultmately decided to focus on the question "How might we allow young professionals to nurter a multitude of relationships with increasingly scarce time?"

				<br /> <br />


				 <h2>Ideation</h2>

				I brainstormed solutions to the problem I wanted to solve by sketching 8 different ideas within two minutes. This allowed me to explore novel solutions. In the end, I settled on the idea of automating the entire process to make it effortless as possible.

				<br /> <br />

				<br /> <br />

				<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
				<p>Having converged from ideation, I extracted functional requirements in the form of user stories, which tied them to user needs. From the user stories, I derived task flows, which would then be used to design the flow of the solution.</p>

				<br /> <br />

				<img src="taskflow.png" />


				<br /> <h2>Prototyping</h2>

				In my prototyping process, I started off on paper (for speed) and I iteratively made improvements based on usability testing. As the flow became more and more cemented, I moved up in fidelity. 

				<a href="First Iteration.png"><img src="First Iteration.png" class="fullscreen mySlides"/></a>

				<A href="Iteration2.png"><img src="Iteration2.png" class="fullscreen" /></A>


				<p><b>Rationale:</b> Iterations 1 and 2 were specifically trying to address the effortlessness element of my hypothesis by cutting out negotiation about date (by aligning calendars) and place (by suggesting places)</p>

				<p><b>Why it didn’t work:</b> It didn’t match the mental model of the users, which disoriented them and actually got in the way.  There was too much requesting/accepting going on, which actually made it less expedient and caused more anxiety. Also, in trying to reduce the back and forth, it cut out the human element so it was very impersonal. It was at this point that I realised the "effortlessness" part of my hypothesis was incorrect. Effort is actually an integral part of the gesture.</p> 

				<a href="Iteration3.png"><img src="Iteration3.png" class="fullscreen"/></a>

				<p><b>Rationale:</b> Cutting out the first request by using mutual contact-adding as a proxy for intention to hang out sometime. Explicitly specifying availability was a way of getting around the fact that being free on a calendar may not mean actually being free, and also to cut down on the number of notifications. This decision was also made in light of the revised hypothesis (i.e. it doesn't have to be effortless any more)</p> 

				<p><b>Why it didn’t work:</b> Although it does make it easier to make plans, it doesn’t address the original problem of keeping in touch with people (i.e. it doesn’t target people you haven’t seen for a while).</p>

				<a href="Iteration4.png"><img src="Iteration4.png" class="fullscreen" "mySlides"/></a>

				<p><b>Rationale:</b> Tying the reminder to time, rather than availability gets further to the core of the problem. Making messaging the main part of the process (rather than competing with it) matches the user’s mental model and retains that humanistic element, allowing them to connect with each other. Giving options (and allowing them to suggest alternatives) makes the decision making easier on both sides. It takes the pressure off of the initiator (who previously had to choose a single place) and it makes it easier for the receiver to give input (recognition over recall).</p>


				<br /> <h2>Going High Fidelity</h2>
				After I had more or less settled on the flow, I increased the fidelity of the design by introducing colour and more detailed design elements. The aim at this point became optimisation.

				<a href="Brand style Guide.png"><img src="logos.png" class="fortyfive" /></a>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				Metrics that would be used if the project were to continue:
				<ul>
					<li /> Sign Ups
					<li />Plans proposed
					<li />Notifications dismissed
				</ul>

				<br />

				<h2>Learnings</h2>
				<ul>
					<li />Always check your flow against your persona’s mental model early on
					<li />Doing research up front is important
					<li />Double check for assumptions and don’t even think about possible solutions until the ideation phase
					<li />Branding before Hi-Fis
				</ul>

				<br />

				<h2>Next Steps</h2>
				<ul>
					<li />Further refinement of prototype
					<li />More research (especially quantitative)
					<li />Concierge mwthod validation
				</ul>
